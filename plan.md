# Plan
This Obsidian plugin will leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the way users interact with their notes. The plugin will create and maintain a Chroma vector database that stores chunked versions of notes along with AI-generated metadata, enabling powerful semantic search and knowledge discovery.

## Core Concept
- Index all Obsidian notes into a Chroma vector database for semantic retrieval
- Use AI to analyze notes and generate enriched metadata (summaries, keywords, entities, etc.)
- Provide a seamless interface for querying the knowledge base and discovering connections
- Enable AI-assisted note taking and knowledge management

## Intelligence Use Case
This plugin is specifically designed for intelligence personnel who need to:
- Ingest and process multiple intelligence reports
- Extract key information (people, equipment, locations, events)
- Find connections between seemingly unrelated reports
- Quickly retrieve relevant information using natural language queries
- Generate comprehensive summaries across multiple documents

# Features

## Database & Indexing
- **Automatic Indexing**: Continuously monitor vault for new/modified notes and update the vector database
- **Chunking Strategy**: Intelligent chunking of notes based on content structure (paragraphs, headers, etc.)
- **Metadata Extraction**: AI-powered generation of:
  - Note summaries
  - Key concepts/topics
  - Named entities (people, places, organizations, equipment)
  - Detected sentiment/tone
  - Classification by intelligence categories (HUMINT, SIGINT, OSINT, etc.)
  - Confidence scores for extracted information
- **Relationship Mapping**: Identify connections between reports that aren't explicitly linked
- **Vector Embeddings**: Generate and store embeddings using Ollama with all-minilm model
- **Incremental Processing**: Process only new or modified notes to minimize performance impact

## User Interface
- **Sidebar Panel**: Dedicated panel for interactions with the RAG system
